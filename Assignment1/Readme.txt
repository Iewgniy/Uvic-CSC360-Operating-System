It's incompleted assignment but I have finished the bg and bglist part. Also, I thik the signal of bgkill,bgstop and bgstart is correct but I didnt test it.
My bug is the part of check_zombieProcess, it cant delete the process has been killed. For pstat, I tried to find out that but I think I forget to check the pid
is existed or not. Thank you!
